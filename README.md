# ESPAlexaFireplace
Control a fireplace with Amazon Alexa using ESP8266.  I have included all the libraries needed for this because that seemed to be the hardest part.

This is the relay module I used.  [Amazon ESP8266 Relay](https://amzn.to/2UayUdr) Cost less then $10. 

You will also need a power supply.  Any power supply 5-12V will work fine.
